Get it on wifi, remote, powering on battery

On battery, run `vcgencmd get_throttled` to make sure the pi isn't throttling from low power.

Setup python and libraries needed on pi
sudo apt install python3
sudo apt install python3-pip
pip install flask flask-socketio pyserial opencv-python numpy --break-system-packages

Local deps:
pip install opencv-python requests python-socketio pillow


`stream.py` goes on raspberry pi.
`SerialControlled.ino` goes onto the Tank Plant arduino.
`controller.py` runs here.



Formatted as "{key_type}:{key}\n", where keytype is "keydown" or "keyup", and key is event.keysym on tk's on_key_press and on_key_release events.
